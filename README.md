Problem Statement: To predict how likely individuals are to receive their XYZ and seasonal flu vaccines.

The provided solution addresses the task of predicting the probability of individuals receiving XYZ and seasonal flu vaccines using a Random Forest model. The solution consists of several key steps, including data preprocessing, model training, making predictions on test data, and preparing a submission file.

Firstly, the training and testing datasets are loaded into Pandas DataFrames. The training data is then preprocessed, which involves handling missing values by filling them with the median, and encoding categorical variables using LabelEncoder. This ensures that all features are numerical and suitable for training the Random Forest model.

Next, the training data is split into features (X) and target variables (Y) for both XYZ and seasonal flu vaccines. The data is further divided into training and validation sets using train_test_split to evaluate the model's performance.

Two Random Forest models are then initialized and trained using the training data. These models are used to predict the probabilities of individuals receiving XYZ and seasonal flu vaccines on the validation set. The performance of the models is evaluated using ROC AUC scores, which indicate how well the models discriminate between positive and negative cases.

Once the models are trained and evaluated, predictions are made on the test data. The same preprocessing steps applied to the training data are also applied to the test data to ensure consistency. Predictions are made using the trained Random Forest models, and probabilities for both XYZ and seasonal flu vaccines are obtained for each individual in the test set.

Finally, a submission file is prepared by creating a DataFrame with respondent IDs and their corresponding predicted probabilities for XYZ and seasonal flu vaccines. This DataFrame is saved to a CSV file without an index column, making it suitable for submission to the competition.

In summary, the solution provides a comprehensive approach to solving the vaccine prediction problem using Random Forest, ensuring proper preprocessing, model training, prediction, and submission file preparation.
